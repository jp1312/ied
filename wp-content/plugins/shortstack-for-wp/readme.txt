**Easily add contests, giveaways, forms and promotions to your WordPress site**
_ShortStack for WordPress_

Create a ShortStack account and get your contest or promotion launched in minutes. Choose one of our professionally designed templates (or start from scratch) and customize it to your liking. When you are ready, [embed it anywhere](https://www.shortstack.com/embedded-campaigns/) in your WordPress site using our plugin. ShortStack’s plugin provides a shortcode to easily place your campaign anywhere you like.

When your contest or promotion is up and running, ShortStack will store all entry data: email addresses, photos, videos, votes and more. You can export your data at any time to use for future marketing efforts. ShortStack also provides in-depth analytics to help you understand where your entrants are coming from, best times to promote, and the overall “health” of your campaign.

More than 400,000 businesses, brands and agencies use ShortStack to create promotions, photos contests and landing pages that generate more sales.
